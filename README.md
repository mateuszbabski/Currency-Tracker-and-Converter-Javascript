# Currency Rates Tracker and Converter

Project not finished in 100%!

I focused on working with API calls from different sources and fetching data from it. So this application is really 2-in-1.

First one is simple currency converter with reversing inputs, showing exchange rate and in future I'd like to implement chart for chosen currencies. For now I must leave it and I'll come back later.

Second one is simple table showing PLN's exchange ratio to the most important currencies. Bid/Ask value, average value, and change compared to data from last week.

A little more work on responsivness and its time to make more complicated projects and learn basics of TypeScript and Node.JS
